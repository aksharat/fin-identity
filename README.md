# Financial Identity
A repo for including all projects related to setting up the process for a financial institution : <br>
##1. Green Card Info Extraction <br>
The project involves developing a deep learning solution, utilizing techniques like YOLO (You Only Look Once), to automatically extract key information from green cards, such as the cardholder's first name and last name, Date of Birth, identification number etc. This involves training a neural network to detect and extract relevant text from green card images, enabling streamlined and accurate data extraction for various applications, including immigration processing, identity verification, and record-keeping.
##2. Customer Entity Resolution <br>
This project focuses on developing a customer entity resolution system with integrated credit score retrieval functionality. Leveraging fuzzy matchmaker techniques and integration with credit bureau databases, the system aims to validate existing customer records stored in our database and retrieve accurate credit scores for credit assessment purposes. The system facilitates data integrity, regulatory compliance, and informed decision-making by ensuring the accuracy and validity of customer information.
